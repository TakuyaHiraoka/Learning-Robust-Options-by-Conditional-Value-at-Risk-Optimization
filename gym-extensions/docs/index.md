Welcome to **gym-extensions**! We're building on top of <a href="https://github.com/openai/gym">OpenAI Gym</a> in the pursuit of creating environments suitable for benchmarking a wide variety of auxiliary tasks. On the RoadMap right now are:

+ Multitask, Transfer, and LifeLong Learning Benchmarks
+ Learning to navigate and search tasks
+ More realistic robotics tasks integrated with ROS and Gazebo

There's a lot of info to go over!

+ You can read about the modified Mujoco OpenAI continuous domain tasks [here](mujoco_gym_envs)
+ You can read about new 2D navigation continuous domain tasks [here](2d_navigation_envs)
+ We also provide a set of wrappers to process agent observations in tasks as described [here](wrappers)
+ Finally, you can enjoy a Brand New SpaceX-like Falcon rocket that can be thought to land on the autonomous drone ship [here](falcon_rocket)

We want all the envs and pull requests we can get! Open an issue if you're confused and we'll fix it ASAP.

In progress documentation:

+ A website for benchmarked multitask runs
+ Pictures and videos
+ A nicer layout
+ How to create new environments and contribute
